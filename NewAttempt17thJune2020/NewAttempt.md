# New Attempt 

After joining [no excuses game jam](https://itch.io/jam/no-excuses-game-jam-2) decided I would revisit this project. Got 4 months to work on it. I have some issues with using unity though. May try without for a while see if I can make something simple that doesn't crash often.

The blueprints define a quite clear vision for the game so I will keep those and perhaps add more.
