The current apk can be downloaded from [http://www.droidbin.com/p1djskc1ms1jafljmrl229o7lu3]

Currently the game does nothing. There are 3 screens (or scenes that are navigable). The game logic is still being worked. It is an idle game where you make patterns that are then replicated by training replicators to churn out your patterns until you reach another level where more complex patterns are needed.
