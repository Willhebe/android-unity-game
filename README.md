# android-unity-game

Testing Stage

### 1 Created [wiki](https://github.com/Willhebe/android-unity-game/wiki) - Had to make project public to Create wiki or pay to upgrade GitHub account. Decided for now prefer to make public.
### 2 Intended Collaborators
#### 2.1 Will (Willhebe) project creator
#### 2.2 Chris
#### 2.3 Lou
### 3 Forked this project (my copy is AndroidUnityGameWillsCopy) I will change things then create pull requests to merge with the master
### 4 Trying to upload files in sensible fashion. First problem I have had is that I shouldn't be adding free assets such as buttons and fonts without permission. Making a second attempt before testing how to recreate project locally.
